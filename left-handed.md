# Left-handed Calligraphy

Calligraphy, like writing in general, can be harder to us southpaws, but it is by no means impossible!

**Writing Position**

First you should determine your way of writing. There are three major methods:  
- **Overhand**, where your hand curls above the line of writing, perhaps turning the paper counterclockwise a bit.
- **Sideways**, where your hand rests at the line of writing, essentially mirroring how right-handed people write, likely with a slant backwards.
- **Underhand**, where your hand rests beneath the line of writing, perhaps turning the paper clockwise a bit.



**The Troubles with Left-handed Calligraphy**

All three methods work fine with day-to-day writing, so why are there troubles when doing calligraphy?

Consider the usual traits of left-handed handwriting.
- writing horizontal strokes right-to-left  
 Sometimes it is impossible to do this in calligraphy due to the ductus... and sometimes it saves you.

- backwards slant  
 Most calligraphy scripts are either upright or slanted forward.

- trouble with ink flow
 This is because most pens are designed to dispense ink while being pulled instead of pushed. In calligraphy dip pens have a similar problem.

The problem then boils down to trying to achieve the right-handed angle of writing. Depending on the script, this means the [nib edge should be at 0-45 degrees to the writing line](http://imgur.com/acno7jb) in the broad edge case; with pointed pen, [the nib should be at somewhere around 50 degrees to the writing line](http://imgur.com/hif1Tv3). Ideally, the nib should be below the writing so that downstrokes are pulled instead of pushed, but one can instead write upside-down.


**Introduction to Tools**

Below is a list of common tools, what they are, and where to get them. There is no need to get all of them, and depending on the way you write most may not even be useful, so this is just an introduction to those tools.

- Straight holder
- Right-handed oblique pen  
 These two are explained in the main article. They are available in most calligraphy stores.  
 Note that the flange for the oblique pen may need some adjustment to get broad edge nibs to fit.
- [Left-handed oblique pen](http://cdn.johnnealbooks.com/images/uploads/4393_4615_large.jpg)  
 Basically a mirror image of right-handed oblique pens.
 This is sold by John Neal and many custom pen makers.
- (Broad Edge specific) [Left-handed nib](http://www.marcuslink.com/pens/assets/nibs-fig-03.gif)  
 A nib cut at an angle. It is available by Brause, Mitchell, and Speedball. Speedball is not exactly great in quality though.
- (Broad Edge specific) [Right-handed nib](http://www.marcuslink.com/pens/assets/nibs-fig-03.gif)  
 A nib cut at an angle. It is available by Brause.  
 Note that in fact, all nibs that are not cut at an angle at all can be considered right-handed. In fact Brause only sells oblique-cut nibs (in both orientations) while Mitchell and Speedball sells straight-cut nibs and left-handed nibs. Tape seems to only make right-handed (straight cut) nibs.


**How to write**

**Broad Edge**: I recommend the booklet [*Insights into left-handed calligraphy*](http://www.johnnealbooks.com/product/insights-into-left-handed-calligraphy/s). It introduces four methods of writing, including  
(Note that below, no oblique nibs are needed and can be replaced with normal nibs if you're willing to curl your hand and / or the paper a bit more)
- The right-handed influence: Underhand with left-handed oblique nib.  
 This is basically trying to achieve the right-handed position by turning the paper a bit and using a left-handed oblique nib.
- The sideways approach: Sideways with right-handed oblique nib or Underhand with left-handed oblique nib.
 This is done by rotating the paper 90Â° clockwise and writing the letters sideways.
- The hook: Overhand with right-handed oblique nib.  
 Basically writing Overhand normally but with stroke orders reversed, and each stroke reversed as well. It is the most natural-feeling for Overhanders, but it is difficult to see what you're writing, and you need to plan out the letter shapes in advance.  
 Writing following the usual ductus means the push strokes become pull strokes, and ink flow can become problematic, but it is certainly possible.
- The upside down: Overhand with right-handed oblique nib.  
 Self explanatory--writing Overhand and with the letters upside down.

These methods serve as a sample of what most left-handers do, but you should certainly experiment and adjust the pens to find out how you work best.  

Generally, broad edge is written with a straight holder, but left-handed oblique holders can help if you're writing underhand and want to curl your hand less. The right-handed angle can potentially be reached this way.  
A right-handed oblique holder may be of some help to reduce wrist fatigue for Overhand methods.


**Pointed Pen**: I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOjh0SkwyCM) by John DeCollibus which shows three methods of writing with a left-handed oblique holder, a straight holder, and a right-handed oblique holder respectively. Note that all methods are Sideways and / or Underhand.  
Overhand can potentially work if you're willing to write upside down. It is possible--but it may be difficult to write a flowing script this way.
